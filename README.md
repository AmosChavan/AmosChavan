# ðŸ“‚ Noteworthy Projects

## AV/ADAS Project: 
Developed an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) to provide real-time information to drivers, enhancing road safety. Key features include:

Lane Detection: Uses Region of Interest, Hough Line detection, and a filtration algorithm.

Pedestrian Detection: Implemented with an SVM ML algorithm.

Vehicle Detection & Traffic Signal Detection: Utilizes Haar-cascade ML algorithms.

Achieves near 20 FPS using OpenMP threading for parallel processing on Ubuntu with OpenCV 4.1.1.
## Cardiac Arrhythmia Detection: 
Led the development of a deep learning model to detect cardiac arrhythmia from ECG data, aiding in early diagnosis and potentially saving lives. This project involved:

Data Processing and Model Building: Used Python and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify ECG signals, achieving 87% accuracy.

Collaboration with Medical Experts: Worked closely with cardiologists to ensure the modelâ€™s clinical relevance, integrating expert feedback to refine the model's performance for real-world healthcare settings.

Outcome: The model demonstrated promising results in early arrhythmia detection, laying the groundwork for future research in AI-driven healthcare applications.
## Real-Time Chat Application: 
Built a full-featured, scalable chat application that supports real-time messaging, providing a seamless communication experience. The project involved:

Backend Development: Utilized Node.js and WebSocket technology to create a responsive server capable of handling multiple simultaneous connections.

Frontend Development: Built the client-side with React, integrating features such as one-on-one messaging, group chats, and message notifications for a user-friendly interface.

Performance and Scalability: Implemented Redis for session management, optimizing WebSocket connections to ensure low latency and high responsiveness, allowing the application to scale effectively.
